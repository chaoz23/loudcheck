# loudcheck

A **loudness compliance verdict**, not raw meter output. `loudcheck` measures
a media file with ffmpeg and answers the question that actually matters —
*does this file pass the spec?* — against formal published standards:

- **EBU R 128** (European broadcast: −23.0 LUFS ±0.5 LU, max −1 dBTP)
- **ATSC A/85** (US television: −24 LKFS ±2 dB, true peak below −2 dBTP)
- **BS.1770** (measure-only: BS.1770 defines no compliance target, so this
  mode returns verdict `measured` with the numbers and no judgment)

```
$ loudcheck master.wav --standard EBU_R128
FAIL — EBU R 128
  ✗ integrated -19.4 LUFS (target -23.0 ±0.5, delta +3.6)
  ✓ true peak -16.3 dBTP (max -1.0)
  · LRA 0.0 LU (informational)
  → apply -3.6 LU gain to reach -23.0 LUFS (e.g. ffmpeg -af volume=-3.6dB, or loudnorm I=-23)
```

Ships as a CLI and an MCP tool over one engine, so agents and humans get the
identical verdict.

## Why this exists

An agent (or an engineer) can run ffmpeg's `ebur128` filter and get numbers.
What it can't get from a shell is the *verdict* — that requires knowing the
standard's target, tolerance, and gating, and interpreting integrated
loudness vs. LRA vs. true peak against them. Loudness is one of the most
common causes of delivery rejection, and the gap is not measurement — it's
the standards-aware answer. That's the whole tool.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .            # CLI (requires ffmpeg >= 5.0 on PATH)
pip install -e ".[mcp]"     # + MCP server
pip install -e ".[dev]"     # + pytest
```

## CLI

```bash
loudcheck file.wav                          # EBU R128 by default
loudcheck file.mp4 --standard ATSC_A85      # first audio stream of a video
loudcheck file.wav --json                   # full structured verdict
loudcheck file.wav --standard BS_1770       # measurement only, no gates
loudcheck file.mov --all-streams            # verdict every audio track
loudcheck file.mov --stream 1               # a specific audio track
loudcheck file.wav --detailed               # + max momentary / short-term
loudcheck masters/ --standard EBU_R128      # batch a directory -> table
loudcheck a.wav b.wav c.wav                 # batch multiple files
loudcheck --schema                          # print the tool definition
```

Batch mode prints one line per file (plus remediation for fails) and a
summary; `--json` in batch emits an array. Exit code is `1` if *any* file
fails.

## For agents

- **Exit codes carry the verdict:** `0` = pass, `1` = fail (non-compliant),
  `2` = error (missing file, no audio stream, no ffmpeg). Gate a delivery on
  the exit code alone.
- **`--json` is the full contract:** overall `verdict`, per-metric
  `measured/target/tolerance/delta/pass` with the spec citation attached to
  every gated metric, `failures` in plain English, and `remediation` with the
  **exact correction** — a fail 2.3 LU over target tells you to apply
  −2.3 LU gain and hands you the ffmpeg incantation. This tool never applies
  the fix (measurement and verdict only); the agent one-shots it with
  `loudnorm` using the delta provided.
- **MCP:** register `python -m loudcheck.mcp_server` (stdio). Tools:
  `check_loudness(path, standard)` → same JSON as the CLI, and
  `list_standards()` → the catalog with citations. Verified against
  `mcp==1.28.1`.
- **`tool.json`** at the repo root describes the surface machine-readably —
  or fetch it live from any install with `loudcheck --schema` (the file ships
  inside the package; a test keeps the two copies in sync).
- **ffmpeg version is part of the contract:** every verdict includes
  `measurement_context.ffmpeg_version`. Minimum supported: 5.0. Developed and
  verified against 8.1.

## The scope guardrail (read before contributing)

**Only formal, stable standards live in this repo; per-platform delivery
templates (Netflix, DPP, Apple TV+, Amazon, broadcaster specs) never do.**
Platform specs change unilaterally and cover far more than loudness — the
moment they enter, this stops being a near-zero-maintenance community tool
and becomes a yearly-maintenance product. If a PR adds a target that a
platform can change on its own, it belongs in a separate template layer
built *on top of* this primitive, not here.

Contributions of additional *formal* standards (e.g. a plain ITU-R BS.1770
mode) are welcome: a standard is pure data in
[`loudcheck/standards.py`](loudcheck/standards.py) — targets, tolerances, and
citations. No code changes required.

## How it measures

One ffmpeg pass with `loudnorm=print_format=json` (analysis mode) yields
integrated loudness, loudness range, true peak (oversampled dBTP per
BS.1770), and the gating threshold. The test suite cross-checks loudnorm's
reading against ffmpeg's independent `ebur128` implementation — the two must
agree within 1 LU for CI to pass, so an ffmpeg release that changes filter
behavior is caught by the suite, not by users.

## Verification corpus

`pytest` generates calibrated test tones on the fly (no binaries in the
repo): per BS.1770's calibration statement, a mono 997 Hz sine at 0 dBFS
reads −3.01 LKFS, so tones are generated at exact known loudness — compliant,
too loud, too quiet, and true-peak-hot — and every verdict must match its
known expectation.

## Out of scope, permanently

Loudness *correction* (use ffmpeg `loudnorm` with the delta this tool gives
you) · full-file QC (codec/colour/cadence) · real-time monitoring · GUIs ·
platform delivery templates (see guardrail).
